# Raiden Network hands-on workshop @ devcon4

This is the repo for the Devcon4 Raiden workshop.
Below you'll find a list of links and information needed to interactively participate in the workshop.

### Prerequisites:
- Access to an Ethereum Kovan RPC endpoint
    - For example through [Infura](https://infura.io/login)
- A Kovan account and KETH. We've created a small tool that generates an account and sends KETH and tokens to it with just one simple command. Please see the [onboarding section](#on-boarding) below for instructions.
- The Raiden client itself. Please see the [getting Raiden](#getting-raiden) section below.
  - If you're on Windows we recommend that you install Raiden for Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)
- We will use [a gitter room](https://gitter.im/raiden-network/devcon4-workshop) for communicating addresses etc. during the workshop

### On-boarding:
We've created a simple script that generates an keystore / address and sends Kovan ETH and Devcon4TestTokens to the generated address. Follow these simple steps:

#### macOS instructions
- Download the onboarder [macOS binary](https://raiden-nightlies.ams3.digitaloceanspaces.com/onboarder-macOS.zip):
```sh
curl -O https://raiden-nightlies.ams3.digitaloceanspaces.com/onboarder-macOS.zip
```
- Unzip the file:
```sh
unzip onboarder-macOS.zip
```
- And run it:
```sh
./onboarder
```

#### Linux instructions
- Download the onboarder [linux binary](https://raiden-nightlies.ams3.digitaloceanspaces.com/onboarder-linux.tar.gz):
```sh
curl -O https://raiden-nightlies.ams3.digitaloceanspaces.com/onboarder-linux.tar.gz
```
- Extract the file:
```sh
tar -xvzf onboarder-linux.tar.gz
```
- And run it:
```sh
./onboarder
```

### Getting Raiden
The fastest way to get up and running is to use the the latest nightly binary releases. Just follow the instructions below.

#### macOS instructions
- Download the [latest nightly macOS binary](https://raiden-nightlies.ams3.digitaloceanspaces.com/raiden-nightly-2018-10-31T06-43-08-v0.15.1.dev7%2Bg29188326-macOS.zip):
```sh
curl -O https://raiden-nightlies.ams3.digitaloceanspaces.com/raiden-nightly-2018-10-31T06-43-08-v0.15.1.dev7%2Bg29188326-macOS.zip
```
- Unzip the file:
```sh
unzip raiden-nightly-2018-10-31T06-43-08-v0.15.1.dev7%2Bg29188326-macOS.zip
```

#### Linux instructions
- Download the [latest nightly linux binary](https://raiden-nightlies.ams3.digitaloceanspaces.com/raiden-nightly-2018-10-31T06-32-56-v0.15.1.dev7%2Bg29188326-linux.tar.gz):
```sh
curl -O https://raiden-nightlies.ams3.digitaloceanspaces.com/raiden-nightly-2018-10-31T06-32-56-v0.15.1.dev7%2Bg29188326-linux.tar.gz
```
- Extract the file:
```sh
tar xvzf raiden-nightly-2018-10-31T06-32-56-v0.15.1.dev7%2Bg29188326-linux.tar.gz
cp raiden-v0.15.1.dev7+g29188326-linux raiden-binary
```

### Running Raiden:
Once Raiden is installed it's time to fire it up. This is done with the following command:
```sh
./raiden-binary \
    --keystore-path keystore \
    --network-id kovan \
    --environment-type development \
    --gas-price 20000000000 \
    --eth-rpc-endpoint YOUR_RPC_ENDPOINT
```

The node will ask you to accept the disclaimer and then ask you to choose which address you want to use. The list should only contain the one address the onboarder tool generated for you.

It will take a bit of time for the node to finish launching.
You'll see that it's ready once you see the message stating that the Rest-API has been started.

You can now access the WebUI at [http://localhost:5001/](http://localhost:5001).

#### Tell the rest

Now that your Raiden node is running please post your address in [our gitter room](https://gitter.im/raiden-network/devcon4-workshop). So others can interact with your node.

### API commands:

#### Open channels
To start with we want to open channels with four already existing nodes. Run the following four commands to open four channels:

**Node 1**
```sh
curl -i -X PUT http://localhost:5001/api/1/channels \
    -H 'Content-Type: application/json' --data-raw \
    '{"partner_address": "0xFa047E7e2Dbc605CE1047d67468371a7bf67E461", \
    "token_address": "0x396764f15ed1467883A9a5B7D42AcFb788CD1826", \
    "total_deposit": 10000000000000000000}'
```

**Node 2**
```sh
curl -i -X PUT http://localhost:5001/api/1/channels \
    -H 'Content-Type: application/json' --data-raw \
    '{"partner_address": "0x8d5b7238925d9C934681430D22A1566dc4d0f9e7", \
    "token_address": "0x396764f15ed1467883A9a5B7D42AcFb788CD1826", \
    "total_deposit": 10000000000000000000}'
```

**Node 3**
```sh
curl -i -X PUT http://localhost:5001/api/1/channels \
    -H 'Content-Type: application/json' --data-raw \
    '{"partner_address": "0x13c0b391A87c1f3eAC9a5a7C17FaC6DFff83b84f", \
    "token_address": "0x396764f15ed1467883A9a5B7D42AcFb788CD1826", \
    "total_deposit": 10000000000000000000}'
```

**Node 4**
```sh
curl -i -X PUT http://localhost:5001/api/1/channels \
    -H 'Content-Type: application/json' --data-raw \
    '{"partner_address": "0x7A96aeA5a95FF6bCDbB7B591f2A7B36faDA4a7e3", \
    "token_address": "0x396764f15ed1467883A9a5B7D42AcFb788CD1826", \
    "total_deposit": 10000000000000000000}'
```

#### Deposit
If you ever need to top up a channel, you can use the following command:
```sh
curl -i -X PATCH http://localhost:5001/api/1/channels/ \
0x396764f15ed1467883A9a5B7D42AcFb788CD1826/ADDRESS_OF_PARTNER \
-H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data-raw '{"total_deposit": 15000000000000000000}'
```

#### Make payments
To make payments, choose any of the above addresses that you opened a channel with and do the following:
```sh
curl -i -X POST http://localhost:5001/api/1/payments/ \
0x396764f15ed1467883A9a5B7D42AcFb788CD1826/ADDRESS_OF_RECEIVER \
-H 'Content-Type: application/json' --data-raw '{"amount": 100000}'
```

Feel free to change the amounts of the payments.
